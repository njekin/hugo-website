I'm a environmental health scientist. Currently I'm a ORISE Postdoctoral Fellow at US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). I am pursueing a career in the field of data-driven environmental and health informatics in academia or industry. While trained in modern molecular microbiology, I bring a broad expertise in fundamental experiment biology that supports a base for design and validation of computationally driven research investigations.

## Formal Coursework & Training
### MOOC certificates from Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University at Coursera  

- Practical Machine Learning
- The Data Scientist’s Toolbox
- Statistical Inference
- Reproducible Research
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Getting and Cleaning Data
- R Programming

### Graduate Level Courses and Training at University of Tennessee:
**Computer Science Courses**  
Fundamentals of Computer Science, Introduction to Data Mining, Advanced Data Mining for Biology   
**Statistical Modeling Courses**   
Probability and statistical modeling, Regression Analysis, Multivariate analysis   
**Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Courses**  
Bioinformatics/Comp Biology, Computational Structural Biochemistry    
(all graduate level classes taken at UTK)  

**Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Research Experience**  
My Ph.D. research focuses on studying the interactions between estrogenic chemicals and human estrogen receptor proteins using both computational and experimental approaches. Therefore, I have hands on experience using High-Performance Computing for Molecular Dynamics Simulation as well as molecular docking studies. I was also involved in a Meta-Genomics/Transcriptomics study on the microbial community of switchgrass rhizosphere using Next Generation Sequencing during my Ph.D. study, in which large quantity of data required both special computational and statistical efforts to analyze. 

**Data Mining Research Experience**  
Being part of the advanced data mining for biology class hosted by Dr. Michael Berry from Computer Science Department at UTK, we collectively analyzed T-cell migration data and generated classifiers for predicting the type of T-cells. This also led to a publication as listed below.
